## Included Files:
+ Bootstrap 3
+ LESS files for Bootstrap nav and button color customization
+ A test template
+ A handful of open-source fonts from font-squirrel

## Example use of the LESS
To produce a stylesheet
(*mySiteNavColors.css*)
with your customizations, try
```
lessc custom-nav.less mySiteNavColors.css
```
or
```
lessc custom-button.less mySiteButtons.css
```
You can link to these stylesheets *after* the core bootstrap.

## Testing
A rudimentary testing template is included as *test.html* 
with stylesheet *custom-test.css*.
